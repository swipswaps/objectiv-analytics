## Welcome to the official Objectiv documentation
Objectiv is a data collection & modeling library that puts the data scientist first. It is built around 
[the open taxonomy of analytics](taxonomy/overview.md), which is our proposal for a common way to collect, 
structure and validate data. With Objectiv, you create a 
[contextual layer for your application](tracking/core-concepts/tagging.md) by mapping it to the taxonomy, 
with the goal of collecting better data and more effective modeling.

#### Key features

* [Event & context classes are predefined](taxonomy/overview.md), designed to ensure the collected data 
  covers a wide range of common analytics use cases. 
* Instrumentation gets validated against the taxonomy to provide 
  [live feedback in your IDE and console while you’re developing](tracking/core-concepts/validation.md).
* Tracked events can carry multiple contexts, including the 
  [exact location in the UI](taxonomy/abstract-contexts/overview.md) from where they were triggered.
* Collected data is well-structured, self-descriptive and gets validated at the first step of the pipeline.
* Familiar Pandas-like dataframe operations can be used on the full data set, straight from a notebook. 
* Models can be built by taking parts of other models. Models can be reused for other projects by changing a 
  single line of code.

## Quick Start

### Play with Objectiv
We’ve set up a [sandboxed notebook with real data from objectiv.io](https://notebook.objectiv.io/) for you to 
play with. Give it a try and see what Objectiv can do.

### Running all Objectiv components Dockerized
This is a great way to run Objectiv locally and to see what it is about. With some additional work this
setup can also be used for low-traffic sites and apps.

The below commands assume that you have `docker-compose` [installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
```bash
docker-compose pull  # pull pre-built images from gcr
docker-compose up    # spin up Objective pipeline
```
This will spin up three images:
* `objectiv_collector` - Endpoint that the Objectiv-tracker can send events to (http://localhost:5000).
* `objectiv_postgres` - Database to store data.
* `objectiv_notebook` - Jupyter notebook that can be used to query the data (http://localhost:8888).

SECURITY WARNING: The above `docker-compose` commands start a postgres container that allows connections
without verifying passwords. Do not use this in production or on a shared system!

### Instrumenting Objectiv
To immediately jump into instrumenting your application, there are detailed How-to Guides for multiple 
platforms and frameworks.
