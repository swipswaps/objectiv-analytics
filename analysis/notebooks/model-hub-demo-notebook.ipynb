Bach is Objectiv’s data modeling library. With Bach, you can use familiar Pandas-like DataFrame operations in your notebook. It uses a SQL abstraction layer that enables models to run on the full dataset, and you can output models to SQL with a single command.\n",

    "* `map` functions always return a series with the same shape and index as the Objectiv Frame they originate from. This ensures they can be added as a column to that Objectiv Frame.\n",
    "* `aggregate` fuctions return aggregated data in some form from the Objectiv Frame. Can also be accessed with `agg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally the Objectiv Frame can be filtered with the `filter` method. `map` functions that return SeriesBoolean can be used with the `filter` method.\n",
