class DataFrame:
    """
    A mutable DataFrame representing tabular data in a database and enabling operations on that data.

    A Bach DataFrame object can be used to process large amounts of data on a database, while using an api
    that is based on the pandas api. This allows the database to group and aggregate data, sample data and
    do other operations that are not suitable for in memory processing. At any time it is possible to write
    your Bach DataFrame to a pandas DataFrame.

    **Usage**

    It should generally not be required to construct DataFrame instances manually. A DataFrame can be
    constructed using the any of the bach classmethods like :py:meth:`from_table`, :py:meth:`from_model`, or
    :py:meth:`from_pandas`. The returned DataFrame can be thought of as a dict-like container for Bach
    Series objects.

    **Getting & Setting columns**

    Getting data works similar to pandas DataFrame. Single columns can be retrieved with ``df['column_name']``
    as well as ``df.column_name``. This will return a single Bach Series. Multiple columns can be retrieved by
    passing a list of column names like: ``df[['column_name','other_column_name']]``. This returns a Bach
    DataFrame.

    A selection of rows can be selected with python slicing. I.e. ``df[2:5]`` returns row 2 to 5. Only
    positive integers are currently accepted in slices.

    SeriesBoolean can also be used to filter DataFrames, and these Series are easily created using comparison
    operations like equals (`==`), less-than (`<`), not(`~`) on two series, or series with values:
    ``boolean_series = a == b``. Boolean indexing can be done like ``df[df.column == 5]``. Only rows are
    returned for which the condition is true.

    **Moving Series around**

    Values, Series or DataFrames can be set to another DataFrame. Setting Series or DataFrames to another
    DataFrame is possible if they share the same base node. This means that they originate from the same data
    source. In most cases this means that the series that is to be set to the DataFrame is a result of
    operations on the DataFrame that is started with.

    **Examples**

    .. code-block:: python

        df['a'] = df.column_name + 5
        df['b'] = ''

    If a Series of DataFrames do not share the same base node, it is possible to combine the data using
    :py:meth:`merge`.


    **Database access**

    The data of this DataFrame is always held in the database and operations on the data are performed
    by the database, not in local memory. Data will only be transferred to local memory when an
    explicit call is made to one of the functions that transfers data:

    * :py:meth:`head`
    * :py:meth:`to_pandas`
    * :py:meth:`get_sample`
    * The property accessors :py:attr:`Series.value` (Series only), :py:attr:`values`

    Other functions will not transfer data, nor will they trigger any operations to run on the database.
    Operations on the DataFrame are combined and translated to a single SQL query, which is executed
    only when one of the above mentioned data-transfer functions is called.

    The API of this DataFrame is partially compatible with Pandas DataFrames. For more on Pandas
    DataFrames see https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html
    """
    # todo note on ordering for slices?
    # todo 'meaning that they originate from the same data source' ok, by approximation
    # todo _get_dtypes also queries the database

    # A DataFrame holds the state of a set of operations on it's base node
    #
    # The main components in this are the dicts of Series that it keeps: `index` and `data`
    # The `data` Series represent all data columns, possibly waiting for aggregation.
    # The `index` Series are used as an index in key lookups, but serve no other purpose but for nice
    # visualisation when converting to pandas Dataframes.
    #
    # When a Series is used as an index, it should be free from any pending aggregation (and thus
    # `Series.group_by` should be None, and its `Series.index` should be `{}`.
    #
    # `DataFrame.group_by` should always match the `Series.group_by` for all Series in the `data` dict.
    #  (and `Series.index` should match `Series.group_by.index`, but that's checked in `Series.__init__`)
    #
    # To illustrate (copied verbatim from Series docs):
    # The rule here: If a series needs a `group_by` to be evaluated, then and only then it should carry that
    # `group_by`. This implies that index Series coming from `GroupBy.index`, do not carry that `group_by`.
    # Only the data Series that actually need the aggregation to happen do.
    #
    # Order is also tracked in `order_by`. It can either be None or a list of SortColumns. Ordering is mostly
    # kept throughout operations, but for example materialization resets the sort order.
